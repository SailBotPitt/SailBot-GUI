exe folder for the gui, github doesnt like files larger than 25mb, which the gui.exe is due to the requirement of uploading
all of the libraries used, therefore I uploaded a zip to google drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=1fe-H-UfprWc4FFiXdXIbiQ_zT3pwMMkn
just download the whole folder, unzip it, and run the GUI.exe application
